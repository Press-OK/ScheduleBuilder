# ScheduleBuilder
An Eclipse Java-based tool for creating and managing weekly schedules, created as a final project for a college-level Java class by Sean Berwick (myself), Steve Markham, and Alvin Alora.

# Purpose
Post-secondary students often get the ability to rearrange their timetables. In our case the web interface for managing timetables was unfortunately quite bad, so we thought, 'Why not make a better system?' ScheduleBuilder allows the user to input their courses and potential times for those courses per week, and allows the user to browse all valid (non-conflicting) iterations of those courses together. I can say it was quite effective as I used it for the subsequent 3 semesters to optimize my timetables in under ten minutes, which would easily have taken hours using the default web interface.

# Features
- Saving and loading of full schedules
- Naming courses and week-layouts, with a sample generation one-click button for testing
- Various filters on the output timetables: Enable/disable specific days, limit hours per day, limit days per week, etc.
- Nice JavaSWT user interface which was very easy to use
